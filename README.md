## Lessons Learned
Through this project, I practiced:

- Building responsive layouts using Flexbox.
- Matching designs to provided mockups for pixel-perfect accuracy.

## Future Enhancements
- Add interactivity with JavaScript (e.g., a dynamic menu or animations).
- Expand the site with additional pages (e.g., About Us, Blog).
